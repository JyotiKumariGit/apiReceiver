Introduction: Event Driven Systems are one of the modern architectural patterns for achieving scalability. Its not trivial to create a completely event driven system and also it not useful in every system you create. Events are useful in some particular kind of systems only. Micro-services is one of the use case to take advantage of Events. We are starting a series of assignments called "Event Chase". Event Chase is a series of multiple small-2 problems to make everyone learn and get better at designing event driven systems. We will get a chance to look at some patterns as well as anti patterns during the course of these assignments. Technologies we are going to learn in this assignment:

Spring Boot Rabbit MQ Problem

Statement 1: Purpose: To generate an event as a message and pass it to a broker system. You are learning "Event-Carried State Transfer" this way. If more interested, read first 2 heading of https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html

Problem: Suppose you have two micro services. Service 1: Responsible to Generating Events Service 2: Responsible fo Receiving Events Rabbit MQ: For transferring the message from Service 1 to Service 2 Use Cases 1: Service 1: Create an api accepting the customer.json file as an Object.

Send the above message to a topic exchange. You can name is whatever you want. Service 2: Create a listener in service 2. This listener should be able to receive message from the above topic exchange. I am assuming you will figure out how to add queue to a listener using GOOGLE SEARCH. Just print the message to the log together with the queue name and routing key. Use Cases 2: Service 1: Create another api accepting the same JSON as an Object.

Send the above message to a direct exchange. You can name is whatever you want. Service 2: Create a new listener in service 2. This listener should be able to receive message from the above direct exchange. I am assuming you will figure out how to add queue to a listener using GOOGLE SEARCH. Just print the message to the log. Together with the queue name. Use Cases 3: Service 1: Create another api accepting the same JSON as an Object.

Send the above message to a Fanout exchange. You can name is whatever you want. Service 2: Create 3 new listener in service 2. All should be able to receive message from the above Fanout Exchange. I am assuming you will figure out how to add queue to a listener using GOOGLE SEARCH. Just print the message to the log. Together with the current queue name
